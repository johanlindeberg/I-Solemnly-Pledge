# I-Solemnly-Pledge
"I Solemnly Pledge" is an educational game developed at MITx: 11.127x Design and Development of Games for Learning.



    What is most important for me to know:
    If you got a very important life-changeing decision to make, then you can try this game, and modify it for your needs with App Inventor. I enclose the source file. So this game is intended for fellow students that use the App Inventor. Tell me what you think. I do not have a mobile phone that works with App Inventor, so I used the emulator.

    If you want to have fun, this might not be a game for you.

    My pitch for 11.127x Design and Development of Games for Learning
    I chose an easy way to adress a complicated problem. It is inspired by this course and by psychology, as presented by Dan Arielys lecture “Who put the monkey in the drivers seat”. I also draw conclusions from my experiences of failure and how to handle that.
    I focus on the situated learning and reinforcement. From the same cue we can get both positive and negative feedback. “This is your worst subject” was brought up as an example during this course. I am going to use feedback in a similar fashion, but the same feedback for both success and failure.
    My focus is everyone everywhere who has a problem with personal longterm lifechanging goals and who can commit to the Game in a wholesome way.
    This game is not fun, it´s only serious. My goal is that the gameplay should be more fun than removing your own appendix without anaesthetic, but on the other hand accomplish goals much on the same scale. This game works as a mentor, of sorts, and as a last resort. But if any other method is better, then try that first. This is meant as solitary play. No group effort. Play before you give up.
    The game is called “I solemnly pledge.” It´s a mobile app with situated learning. You download the free app, after much consideration. This game will begin but never end. You begin by identifying your worst subject. Lets say it´s eating too much. But it could be other things like spending, smoking etc. It can also be something that you want accomplish, like being good at maths. Or eating to little. Choose a well defined long term goal that is hard but that you really need to accomplish.

    Before you begin the game you must enact a ritual:
    Contemplate your goal in silence for two minutes.
    Say aloud: I solemnly pledge to reach my goal: A clearly defined goal.
    This ritual can be repeated regularly, for example before you go to sleep.
    Then the game begins.

    Every time you have acted, in relevance to your goal, you start your app. The app will give you the message: An image, sound, vibration etc. This can possibly be accompanied with some simple statistics such as time, frequency, GPS, merit badges etc.
    Then you push the button “I Pledge”. This reinforces your pledge. A simple game mechanic. The mobile device then vibrates.
    If you stop playing and you believe you have failed, then the game continues.

    Freedom of play:
    Explore: yes, in a sense. You get to explore inside the confines of your pledge. Maybe you devote less time to other subjects.
    Identity: Yes, you may become a new person. It´s a personality operation. In fact you may disappear and be replaced by another person with a new skill set.
    Effort: yes, you can choose to make the game more or less intense. For example by playing much longer.
    Ways to win: yes, everytime you fail is a new opportunity to win. Every reaction is proportional to the action. Every different choice is a new road to success. If you succeed then the message is positive, if you want to stop doing something then the message is reinforcing the necessesity of pressing on.

    Gaminess:
    Interesting choices: Yes. How do you keep the sum of vices constant? This can be done in many ways. What are your priorities?
    Concequences of these choices: Yes. All concequences are success except for breaking your pledge. So you could start with cocain instead of smoking. Or smoking instead of eating. This could be a problem.
    Many ways to win: Yes. Everytime you succeed is a small victory, possibly in a new setting.
    Feedback: yes, immediate. Everytime you act you get a feedback. Even if you stop, because you would have to be good at lying to yourself not to know that you have failed.
    Underlying system: yes. Very simple but situated and dynamic. It maps the players behaviour perfectly, even when the player stops playing. You may quit the game but the Game never lets you go. Basicly because the old you never lets the new you go.
    This game is free to use for everyone, in much the same sense that “beating yourself with a stick” is a free option. Remember that everything will be ok in the end. If it´s not ok, it´s not the end.
